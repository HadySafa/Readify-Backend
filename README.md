## Development Approach

The development of this project was carried out in **7 key phases**:

1. **Defining Project Features** – identified core and extra functionalities.  
2. **Database Design** – structured entities, relationships, and constraints.  
3. **Project Setup**  
   - **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Axios  
   - **Backend:** ASP.NET Core, Dapper, MySQL ( For Database)
4. **Authentication & State Management** – implemented token-based authentication using **JWTs** and configured global state with **Redux**.  
5. **Feature Development** – built admin functionalities first, followed by user features.  
6. **Testing** – validated APIs and UI with **Postman**, **Swagger**, and **browser developer tools**.  
7. **Documentation** – prepared detailed project documentation.

I’ve shared a detailed breakdown of these phases in a series of LinkedIn posts.
